  The readings delved into a conflict that troubles Digital Humanities. While collaboration and the presence of different fields of study are present, what the worry for some of the academics would be on the theory behind Digital Humanitites. Coming from a more objective point-of-view (the Digital, the Sciences), it does become a bit confusing, as I'd view the different technological systems as tools to help in analysis that might have been otherwise difficult to do manually. That said, I'd understand that the people from the humanitites would search for a kind of foundation that powers the field of Digital Humanities. Theories provide frameworks that we work upon to understand how certain things would work, and why certain things are. Remebering that the humanities approach these ideas through deconstruction, this whole worry of DH not being based on theory now makes more sense. That said, from my point of view, DH works through a collaborative effort, and in the process of collaboration, we get these different insights and ideas, based on theories which the humanities have to offer. And so, in the creation of these different mediums and tools for DH, it becomes possible to model them in accordance with the theoretical aspects. Technology nowadays isn't limited to what gets displayed or how complicated the processes are so that they work, which is the beauty of having Digital Humanities in the now. Designs and adjustments can always be readily done to adjust the models and tools to be used. Which highlights the most beautiful part of DH, the collaboration that moves our understanding of this field forward, and maybe by then, we would be able to have a deeper understanding of it.
