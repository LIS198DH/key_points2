The key points of this week's readings are the ff. 
- Digital Humanities as a discipline also relies on humanistic and literary theoretical frameworks.
- Conflicts within the practice of DH are much easier to resolve since the problems does not only gravitate upon theories
- Theories as frameworks not limited to only  a specific disicpline but rather something that is free for everyone to incorporate in their own projects or works.
-Theory in the context of Digital Humanities is not something which only refer to concepts provided by philosophers and theorists but also the system as the theory or the theoretical work itself
- The essence of humanities in the act of hacking or building is to make sure that one's system is ethical : that a work which lacks a grounding in humanistic theories might reproduce "a problematic social world"
-The clarification made by digital humanists on the notion that Digital Humanities tend to be more on "doing" rather than "saying" : that digital humanists do try balancing out these two concepts in their works.
-A suggestion for the opposing sides : that non- DH humanists should stop accusing digital humanists as reducing cultural study to a "word frequency historiograms" and that digital humanists should not relegate theories as " a code word for the same old same old".
