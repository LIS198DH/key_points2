The key idea that I got from the readings, in particular from Natalia Cecire's Introduction (that's the only reading 
I managed to finish),  is her establishing the main role and virtue of digital humanities in dismantling and at the 
same time in building things within our current societal structures. The potential of theory in Digital Humanities is that
with DH one can establish so much knowledge from a bigger set of concrete data, and from it we can, in my own words,
more "efficiently" and "effectively" affect social change, as thee role of theory should be. We are presented with this
potential but we are also reminded to root our developments of DH in the theories of humanities, to fulfill the role of DH.
Personally, I still do find it mindblowing how significantly dense knowledge is and will be with sets of data, archives, etc.
