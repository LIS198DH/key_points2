The hack vs yack dichotomy is about the relationship between doing and discussing. It is the nexus between science and humanities where methodology meets theory. DH exists in a weird overlap where science wishes for rigor and reproduction of methods while the humanities perfers novelty in every exercise.
To be a digital humanist, we must do both. Technology must become more than just an application of known science concepts, it must also be tool for creating new knowledge.
The desire for grounding DH to theories is an effort to 'legitimize' it as applicable to already existing fields. It must be interdisciplinary, pandisciplinary, but not nondisciplinary.
