Key Points from Readings: 
- In the digital humanities, one learns by "doing". There is a need to create and to experiement.  
- However, it is important not to fall into the trap of thinking that the act of "doing" itself is sufficient (for lack of a better word) because it "lives out" theory. Work in the digital humanities should aspire to be transformative. 
- Just as art cannot simply be done for "art's sake", work in the digital humanities is not meaningful or transformative if it is not founded upon theory.  
- The digital humanities cannot be separated from social issues. An interesting point that illustrates this would be the emergence of notions of "doing" that are tied to economic "progress". This is problematic since these notions of progress are typically associated with a particular class of society (white, male, blue-collar) that is priveleged. 
- Digital tools play a big role in the furthering of the humanities in contemporary times. These tools not only allow us to more effectively communicate and collaborate with others, but also generate new ways of seeing and new ways of processing knowledge.
