Digital Humanities, just like in Sociology, has problems that the ones who made the theories are all from the white blue-collared men which means, there’s no representation from all aspects of the societies.
Digital Humanities in its heart is using technology to create new objects for humanistic interrogation. 
The readings also stated that digital humanities need to put theory first, the reason being, “not to pacify the powers-that-be, but to harness their own creativity towards productive ends” however this point has become moot as it was then argued that the “database is the theory” and that digital humanists are doing the theory. In building, what we had in mind is always different from what we have done and instead of lurking into the differences between the two, we should celebrate those differences. 
Projects in Digital Humanities also work methodologically instead of theoretically. They basically considers how will theory affect or help their work rather than thinking/debating over what is the theory behind the work as a theoretical approach has the tendency of never being solved, rather digital humanists most often just chooses a way of doing and just proceeds.
