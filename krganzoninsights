From this week's readings, the issues raised about the field of digtal humanities are, firstly, the "undertheorizing" of the field. From the Humanities side of the academe, digital humanities could not (at least, not yet) establish and institutionalize itself when the "Theory" that informs it is not the "Theory" that the Humanities are used to. Similarly, from the natural sciences point of view, the fact that DH is informed by Theory complicates its rules about "objective" experimentation and data gathering. It is also hard for both sides to understand the potential for research and new paradigms of understanding in "interpretative archiving". Moreover, it becomes difficult to settle this debate of valuing hacking over yacking (and vice-versa) when within the field of DH itself, digital humanists also argue about how there's not enough or there's too much theory in DH projects and research. The debate of hack-yack makes it difficult for both the humanities and the natural sciences to fully accept and support the DH field.
