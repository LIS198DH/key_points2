- The new medium brought by the digital age brings us perceiving and knowing the world.
  - Which calls for new models to interpret these new "texts" from a perspective that takes into
    account this digital turn.
- DH needs theory to ground its practice in humanistic traditions.
  - Theory meaning the already established discourses in the humanities
  - This would not mean that the old humanistic traditions will force itself into this new field;
    but that in interdisciplinary fields, discourses like these -- in which the two disciplines seem to
    be negotiating a common ground where to operate from -- is necessary.
- Technology tends to unknowingly serve the dominating system, which is why we need theory -- because it
  makes us see the world from a new perspective.
  - Thus, DH being sort of anti-establishmentarian
- Both coders and critics have to learn the basics of the other field -- have to learn to notice
  the things that the other field does -- in order to adjust the way they see their own fields to the
  needs of the other field.
